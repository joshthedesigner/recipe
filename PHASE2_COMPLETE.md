# ✅ Phase 2 Complete: Supabase Setup

## What We Accomplished

Congratulations! Your database and authentication system are now set up! 🎉

## ✅ What's Now in Place

### 1. **Database Tables Created** (in Supabase)
- ✅ **`recipes`** table - Stores all recipes with `user_id` for attribution
- ✅ **`favorites`** table - Tracks which recipes each user has favorited
- ✅ **`profiles`** table - Stores user display names (like "Mom" or "Dad")

### 2. **Storage Bucket Created**
- ✅ **`recipe-photos`** bucket - For storing cookbook photos

### 3. **Security Configured**
- ✅ Row Level Security enabled on all tables
- ✅ Users can only edit/delete their own recipes
- ✅ Everyone can view all recipes
- ✅ Storage policies set up for photo uploads

### 4. **Connection Files Created** (in your project)
- ✅ `.env.local` - Your Supabase credentials stored securely
- ✅ `lib/supabase.ts` - Main database connection
- ✅ `lib/supabase-browser.ts` - Browser client
- ✅ `lib/auth-helpers.ts` - Login/signup helper functions
- ✅ `lib/test-connection.ts` - Database testing utility

### 5. **Test Page Created**
- ✅ `app/test-db/page.tsx` - A page to verify database connection

## 🧪 How to Test Your Setup

1. Make sure your dev server is running:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/test-db
   ```

3. You should see checkmarks (✅) for all three tables:
   - ✅ Recipes Table
   - ✅ Favorites Table
   - ✅ Profiles Table

If you see all checkmarks, everything is working perfectly!

## 📊 Database Schema Summary

### `recipes` table
Each recipe stores:
- Who added it (`user_id`) - **Your new feature!** 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
- Recipe name, ingredients, cuisine, difficulty
- Cooking time and notes
- Full recipe text (extracted from photos/URLs)
- Photo URL and source link

### `favorites` table
Links users to their favorite recipes

### `profiles` table
Stores display names so recipes show "Added by Mom" instead of "Added by user@email.com"

## 🔐 Security Features

Your database is now secure:
- ✅ Users must be logged in to add recipes
- ✅ Users can only edit/delete their own recipes
- ✅ Everyone can view all family recipes (shared collection)
- ✅ Favorites are private to each user

## 🔜 Next Phase: Backend API Functions (Phase 3)

Now that your database is ready, we'll build the functions that:
- ✅ Add recipes to the database
- ✅ Search and filter recipes
- ✅ Add/remove favorites
- ✅ Get recipes by specific family members (using `user_id`)

## 📝 Phase 2 Status: **COMPLETE** ✅

Your Supabase setup is done! The foundation for storing and managing recipes is now in place.

**Ready for Phase 3?** Just let me know and I'll start building the backend API functions! 🚀
