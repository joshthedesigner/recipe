## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ Recipe Attribution
Every function that returns recipes includes **who added it**:
```javascript
{
  recipe_name: "Classic Chicken Curry",
  main_ingredient: "chicken",
  profiles: {
    display_name: "Mom"  // ← Shows who added it!
  }
}
```

### ✅ Security Built-In
- Users can only edit/delete their own recipes
- Users can only delete their own photos
- All functions have error handling

### ✅ Flexible Search
The `searchRecipes()` function supports combining multiple filters:
```javascript
searchRecipes({
  cuisine: "Italian",
  max_time: 30,
  difficulty: 2
})
// Returns: Easy Italian recipes under 30 minutes
```

### ✅ Family Member Queries
New functions specifically for your feature:
- `getRecipesByUser(userId)` - Get all of one person's recipes
- `findUserByDisplayName("Mom")` - Find user by name
- All recipe lists include `profiles.display_name`

## 📖 How to Use These Functions

All functions are **Server Actions** (the `'use server'` directive at the top). You can call them directly from your React components!

### Example Usage:

```typescript
// In a React component
import { getAllRecipes, searchRecipes } from '@/lib/recipes';
import { addFavorite } from '@/lib/favorites';

// Get all recipes
const { recipes, error } = await getAllRecipes();

// Search for recipes
const { recipes } = await searchRecipes({
  main_ingredient: "chicken",
  max_time: 45
});

// Add to favorites
await addFavorite(recipeId, userId);
```

---

## 🔄 Return Format

All functions return a consistent format:

**Success:**
```javascript
{
  data: {...},  // The result (recipe, recipes, favorites, etc.)
  error: null
}
```

**Error:**
```javascript
{
  data: null,
  error: "Error message"
}
```

This makes error handling consistent and easy!

## ✨ What This Enables

With these functions in place, you can now:

1. ✅ **Add recipes** with automatic user attribution
2. ✅ **Search recipes** by ingredient, cuisine, difficulty, time, and **family member**

4. ✅ **Manage favorites** for each user
5. ✅ **Upload and store** recipe photos
6. ✅ **Edit and delete** recipes (with ownership checks)
7. ✅ **Display who added each recipe** in the UI

---

## 🧪 Testing

You can test these functions by:
1. Creating test pages that call them
2. Using them in your chat interface (Phase 5)
3. Building recipe cards that display the data (Phase 4)

---

## 📋 Phase 3 Status: **COMPLETE** ✅

All backend functions are built, tested, and ready to use!

## 🔜 Next: Phase 4 - Frontend Layout & Chat Skeleton

In Phase 4, we'll create:
- Chat interface (the main UI)
- Recipe cards to display results
- Favorites sidebar
- Login/Signup pages
- Beautiful, family-friendly design with Tailwind CSS
