# 🧠 Phase 5: AI Integration with Groq - STARTED!

## ✅ What's Been Added

### 1. **Groq SDK Installed** 🦙
- Fast, free AI responses
- Using Llama 3.1 70B model
- No cost, no rate limits (generous free tier)

### 2. **Groq Client** (`lib/groq-client.ts`)
Three main AI functions:

**`chatWithGroq(messages, model)`**
- Send messages to Groq AI
- Get conversational responses
- Handles errors gracefully

**`extractRecipeData(recipeText)`**
- Extracts structured data from recipe text
- Returns JSON with all recipe fields
- Perfect for OCR text processing

**`parseNaturalLanguageQuery(query)`**
- Converts natural language to database filters
- Examples:
  - "chicken recipes" → `{main_ingredient: "chicken"}`
  - "Easy Italian under 30 min" → `{cuisine: "Italian", difficulty: 2, max_time: 30}`
  - "Find Mom's recipes" → `{user_name: "Mom"}`

### 3. **Chat API Route** (`app/api/chat/route.ts`)
Intelligent API endpoint that:
- Receives user messages
- Parses queries with AI
- Searches database if it's a recipe query
- Returns conversational responses
- Supports searching by user name ("Mom's recipes")

### 4. **ChatInterface Updated**
- Now connected to AI backend
- Sends messages to `/api/chat`
- Displays AI responses
- Maintains conversation history
