# 🧠 Conversation Memory Enhancement

## ✅ What I Just Fixed

The AI now has **much better memory** and can reference past conversations and pending recipes!

---

## 🎯 New Capabilities

### **1. Remembers Pending Recipes**
If you share a recipe but haven't saved it yet, the AI remembers it!

**Example:**
```
You: "Spaghetti, olive oil, garlic. Boil pasta, sauté garlic, mix."
AI: "Got it ✅ Here's the recipe I extracted: **Garlic Spaghetti**..."

You: "What recipe did I just share with you?"
AI: "You just shared **Garlic Spaghetti** — an Italian recipe with spaghetti as the main ingredient, about 20 minutes to make. Ready to save it?"
```

### **2. More Conversation History**
- **Before:** Only last 5 messages
- **After:** Last 10 messages for better context

### **3. Recipe Context Injection**
When you have a pending recipe, the AI receives:
- Recipe name
- Main ingredient
- Cuisine type
- Difficulty level
- Cook time

---

## 🧪 Test These Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Ask About Shared Recipe**
```
Step 1: Paste a recipe (e.g., "chicken, soy sauce, honey, garlic")
Step 2: Wait for AI to extract it
Step 3: Ask: "What recipe did I just share with you?"

Expected: AI names the recipe (e.g., "You just shared **Honey Garlic Chicken**...")
```

### **Scenario 2: Modify Pending Recipe**
```
Step 1: Share a recipe
Step 2: Say: "Change the time to 30 minutes"

Expected: AI updates the cook time ✅
(Note: This requires saving and re-extracting, or future edit feature)
```

### **Scenario 3: Reference Earlier Conversation**
```
Step 1: Ask: "What can you do?"
Step 2: Later ask: "Can you do that thing you mentioned earlier?"

Expected: AI references previous messages
```

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### **1. ChatInterface Component**
```typescript
// Before
conversationHistory: messages.slice(-5)

// After
conversationHistory: messages.slice(-10),
pendingRecipe: pendingRecipe  // Pass current pending recipe
```

### **2. Chat API Route**
```typescript
// Added pendingRecipe parameter
const { message, conversationHistory, pendingRecipe } = await request.json();

// Inject recipe context into system prompt
let recipeContext = '';
if (pendingRecipe) {
  recipeContext = `**CURRENT CONTEXT**: The user just shared a recipe...
  - Recipe Name: ${pendingRecipe.recipe_name}
  - Main Ingredient: ${pendingRecipe.main_ingredient}
  ...`;
}
```

### **3. Enhanced System Prompt**
- Added "REMEMBER CONTEXT" behavior
- Added examples of referencing past recipes
- Instructs AI to use pending recipe details

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. **User shares recipe** → Extracted and stored in `pendingRecipe` state
2. **User asks follow-up** → `pendingRecipe` sent to API with message
3. **AI receives context** → System prompt includes recipe details
4. **AI responds** → References the specific recipe by name

---

## 🎨 Example Conversations

### **Example 1: Basic Memory**
```
You: "Pasta, olive oil, garlic, cook 15 min"
AI: "Got it ✅ **Garlic Pasta** extracted. Save it?"

You: "What was that recipe called?"
AI: "That was **Garlic Pasta** — a simple Italian pasta dish with garlic and olive oil, takes about 15 minutes. Want to save it?"
```

### **Example 2: Multiple Questions**
```
You: (pastes long recipe URL)
AI: "Great! I extracted **Beef Stroganoff**..."

You: "How long does it take?"
AI: "The **Beef Stroganoff** I just extracted takes about 45 minutes. Ready to save?"

You: "What's the difficulty?"
AI: "It's rated 3 out of 5 difficulty — moderate skill level. Want to save it now?"
```
